# [Hugo Blox Builder](https://hugoblox.com) is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the Hugo Blox Builder which this template is built upon handles the rest.

# **Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!**

# On this page, you'll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.

# ## Video

# Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:

# {{< youtube D2vj0WcvH5c >}}

# **Youtube**:

#     {{</* youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc */>}}

# **Bilibili**:

#     {{</* bilibili id="BV1WV4y1r7DF" */>}}

# **Video file**

# Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your `assets/media/` media library or in your [page's folder](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/), and then embedding them with the _video_ shortcode:

#     {{</* video src="my_video.mp4" controls="yes" */>}}

# ## Podcast

# You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page's folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the _audio_ shortcode:

#     {{</* audio src="ambient-piano.mp3" */>}}

# Try it out:

# {{< audio src="ambient-piano.mp3" >}}

# ## Test students

# Provide a simple yet fun self-assessment by revealing the solutions to challenges with the `spoiler` shortcode:

# ```markdown
# {{</* spoiler text="ðŸ‘‰ Click to view the solution" */>}}
# You found me!
# {{</* /spoiler */>}}
# ```

# renders as

# {{< spoiler text="ðŸ‘‰ Click to view the solution" >}} You found me ðŸŽ‰ {{< /spoiler >}}

# ## Math

# Hugo Blox Builder supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the `math` option in your `config/_default/params.yaml` file.

# To render _inline_ or _block_ math, wrap your LaTeX math with `{{</* math */>}}$...${{</* /math */>}}` or `{{</* math */>}}$$...$${{</* /math */>}}`, respectively.

# {{% callout note %}}
# We wrap the LaTeX math in the Hugo Blox _math_ shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown.
# {{% /callout %}}

# Example **math block**:

# ```latex
# {{</* math */>}}
# $$
# \gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}
# $$
# {{</* /math */>}}
# ```

# renders as

# {{< math >}}
# $$\gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}$$
# {{< /math >}}

# Example **inline math** `{{</* math */>}}$\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})${{</* /math */>}}` renders as {{< math >}}$\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})${{< /math >}}.

# Example **multi-line math** using the math linebreak (`\\`):

# ```latex
# {{</* math */>}}
# $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=1, \\
# 1-p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=0.\end{cases}$$
# {{</* /math */>}}
# ```

# renders as

# {{< math >}}

# $$
# f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=1, \\
# 1-p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=0.\end{cases}
# $$

# {{< /math >}}

# ## Code

# Hugo Blox Builder utilises Hugo's Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. The code theme can be selected in the `config/_default/params.yaml` file.


#     ```python
#     import pandas as pd
#     data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
#     data.head()
#     ```

# renders as

# ```python
# import pandas as pd
# data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
# data.head()
# ```

# ## Inline Images

# ```go
# {{</* icon name="python" */>}} Python
# ```

# renders as

# {{< icon name="python" >}} Python

Course Description:
This course offers an introduction to computational chemistry and molecular simulation, which are essential components to modern-day science and engineering, as they can provide both mechanistic insights underlying observed phenomena and predictions on thermodynamic/kinetic properties. Through pedagogical treatment of essential background, basic algorithmic implementation, and applications, students will develop knowledge necessary to follow, appreciate, and devise computational 'experiments'. Topics of emphasis include quantum chemical solution methods, Monte Carlo & molecular dynamics, and free energy/enhanced sampling.

Princeton's registrar [website](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1252&courseid=012551). In reviews of the course, we were fortunate to say that the students rated us 4.98/5 stars for the overall course quality!
