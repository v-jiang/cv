## Abstract
We developed a remote lab experience where freshmen grew and analyzed the activity of sourdough starters as a means of engaging with chemical engineering concepts. This six-week hands-on activity was targeted due to its low-cost, non-hazardous materials, and ability to be conducted safely in a non-laboratory setting. By designing the lab to be guided inquiry, we embraced the inherent variability students would encounter running these experiments remotely to create a motivating learning experience.
