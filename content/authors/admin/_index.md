## About Me

Virginia is a PhD candidate in Chemical and Biological Engineering coadvised by Jerelle Joseph and Jos√© Avalos. who received an undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering at Columbia University in 2021. Prior to starting at Princeton, Virginia worked as a scientific associate in drug discovery at D.E. Shaw Research. They are interested in modeling biomolecular condensates to modulate reaction rates for metabolic engineering. Outside of lab, Virginia enjoys hiking, trying new food, and crafting toys for cats.
