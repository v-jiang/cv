abstract: We identified and characterized a molybdenum/tungsten transport protein (ModA/WtpA) of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and demonstrated the binding of tungstate, molybdate, and chromate. We used computational design to expand the binding capabilities of the protein to include perrhenate. A disulfide bond was engineered into the binding pocket of ModA/WtpA to introduce a more favorable geometric coordination and surface charge distribution for oxyanion binding. The mutant protein experimentally demonstrated a 2-fold higher binding affinity for molybdate and 6-fold higher affinity for perrhenate. The overexpression of the wild-type and mutant ModA/WtpA proteins in A. ferrooxidans cells enhanced the innate tungstate, molybdate, and chromate binding capacities of the cells to up to 2-fold higher. In addition, the engineered cells expressing the mutant protein exhibited enhanced perrhenate binding, showing 5-fold and 2-fold higher binding capacities compared to the wild-type and ModA/WtpA-overexpressing cells, respectively. Furthermore, the engineered cell lines enhanced biocorrosion of stainless steel as well as the recovered valuable metals from an acidic wastewater generated from molybdenite processing. The improved binding efficiency for the oxyanion metals, along with the high selectivity over nontargeted metals under mixed metal environments, highlights the potential value of the engineered strains for practical microbial metal reclamation under low pH conditions.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Rhenium and molybdenum are critically important metals, but mining is bad for the environment. Using engineered microbes, we can extract these rare earth metals from alternative sources like e-waste.
