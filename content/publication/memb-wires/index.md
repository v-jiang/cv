abstract: Cyc2 is the key protein in the outer membrane of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans that mediates electron transfer between extracellular inorganic iron and the intracellular central metabolism. This cytochrome c is specific for iron and interacts with periplasmic proteins to complete a reversible electron transport chain. A structure of Cyc2 has not yet been characterized experimentally. Here we describe a structural model of Cyc2, and associated proteins, to highlight a plausible mechanism for the ferrous iron electron transfer chain. A comparative modeling protocol specific for trans membrane beta barrel (TMBB) proteins in acidophilic conditions (pH ~â€‰2) was applied to the primary sequence of Cyc2. The proposed structure has three main parts. Extracellular loops exposed to low-pH conditions, a TMBB, and an N-terminal cytochrome-like region within the periplasmic space. The Cyc2 model was further refined by identifying likely iron and heme docking sites. This represents the first computational model of Cyc2 that accounts for the membrane microenvironment and the acidity in the extracellular matrix. This approach can be used to model other TMBBs which can be critical for chemolithotrophic microbial growth.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a bacteria species that is able to grow off of carbon dioxide and iron and sulfur alone. In this paper I suggest a model for how the bacterium is able to harvest electrons from metals for carbon metabolism.
